# WuTang Beats Challenge

Hey there! Let's have some fun with numbers and music. We're going to print some numbers, but we're going to change it up a bit with some musical vibes from WuTang.

## Your Task:

1. Write a simple program that goes through numbers from 1 up to a number `n` you choose.
2. For every number that can be divided by 3 without any leftover, instead of the number, print "Wu".
3. If a number can be divided by 5 without leaving anything behind, instead of the number, shout out "Tang".
4. Here's the cool part: if a number can be divided by BOTH 3 and 5, get excited and yell "WuTang Forever"!

## How it Should Look Like:

Let's see a quick example:

```
1
2
Wu
4
Tang
Wu
7
8
Wu
Tang
11
Wu
13
14
WuTang Forever
```

## Once You're Done:

Make sure to save your awesome program, and then share it on GitHub so we can all jam to your beats!

Remember, coding can be fun and musical! Enjoy and WuTang Forever! ðŸŽµðŸ”¢
