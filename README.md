# WuTang Beats Challenge

Hey there! Let's have some fun with numbers and music. We're going to print some numbers, but we're going to change things up with some musical vibes from WuTang.

## Your Task:

1. Write a simple program that goes through numbers from 1 up to a number `n` you choose.
2. For every number that can be divided by 3 without any remainder, instead of the number, print "Wu".
3. If a number can be divided by 5 without leaving anything behind, instead of the number, shout out "Tang".
4. Here's the cool part: if a number can be divided by BOTH 3 and 5, get excited and yell "WuTang Forever"!

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 1:
Input:
```java
int n = 15;
```

```
